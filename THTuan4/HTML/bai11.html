    <p style="text-align: justify;width: 60%;margin: 0 auto;">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

        Objective:	To learn what CSS is.
        In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles â€” very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.
